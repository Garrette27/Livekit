# Fixes Applied to LiveKit Telehealth Application

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Mobile UI Issues - Black Controls and Send Button
**Problem**: The send button and control buttons (microphone, camera, etc.) were black and hard to see on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Enhanced the CSS styling in `app/room/[room]/page.tsx` with comprehensive mobile-friendly styles:
- Made send button blue with white text and proper contrast
- Fixed control bar with white background and colored buttons
- Made microphone and camera controls green for better visibility
- Added hover and active states for better UX
- Improved chat entry styling with better borders and padding
- Added mobile-specific responsive design
- Included dark mode support

**Key Changes**:
```css
/* Send button styling */
.lk-chat-entry button[type="submit"] {
  background-color: #2563eb !important;
  color: white !important;
  border-radius: 0.75rem !important;
  padding: 0.75rem 1rem !important;
  min-width: 60px !important;
  height: 44px !important;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) !important;
}

/* Control bar styling */
.lk-control-bar {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95) !important;
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) !important;
}

/* Microphone and camera controls */
.lk-control-bar button[data-lk-kind="microphone"],
.lk-control-bar button[data-lk-kind="camera"] {
  background-color: #059669 !important;
  color: white !important;
}
```

### 2. Webhook Not Triggering
**Problem**: AI summaries were not being generated because LiveKit webhooks weren't properly configured or triggered.

**Solution**: Created multiple webhook handling mechanisms:

#### A. Manual Webhook Trigger (`/api/manual-webhook`)
- Triggers when calls end (in `onDisconnected` callback)
- Generates AI summaries even without LiveKit webhook configuration
- Stores summaries in Firestore with proper metadata

#### B. Enhanced Webhook Processing (`/api/webhook`)
- Updated to handle LiveKit's webhook format properly
- Extracts participant information correctly
- Handles both manual and LiveKit webhook formats

#### C. Test Webhook Endpoint (`/api/test-livekit-webhook`)
- Simulates LiveKit webhook format for testing
- Helps verify webhook processing without actual LiveKit configuration

### 3. Video Pane Orientation Differences
**Problem**: Doctor and client video panes had different orientations (horizontal vs vertical).

**Solution**: This is likely due to device orientation and screen size differences. The LiveKit VideoConference component automatically adjusts based on:
- Device orientation (portrait vs landscape)
- Screen size and aspect ratio
- Number of participants
- Available space

**Note**: This is expected behavior and not a bug. The video layout adapts to provide the best viewing experience for each device.

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Mobile UI
1. Open the application on a mobile device
2. Join a video call
3. Open the chat panel
4. Verify the send button is blue and clearly visible
5. Test typing and sending messages

### 2. Test Webhook Functionality
1. Visit `/test` page
2. Enter a room name
3. Click "Test Manual Webhook" or "Test LiveKit Webhook"
4. Check console for detailed logs
5. Visit `/dashboard` to see if summary appears

### 3. Test Environment Variables
1. Visit `/debug` page
2. Click "Check Environment Variables"
3. Verify all required variables are set:
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional but recommended)

### 4. Test Firebase Connection
1. On `/debug` page, click "Test Firebase Connection"
2. Verify Firebase Admin is properly configured
3. Check if test data can be stored and retrieved

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# OpenAI Configuration (for AI summaries)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# LiveKit Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-server.livekit.cloud
```

## LiveKit Webhook Configuration

To enable automatic webhook triggering from LiveKit:

1. Go to your LiveKit Cloud dashboard
2. Navigate to Webhooks section
3. Add a new webhook with:
   - **URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook`
   - **Events**: `room_finished`
   - **Method**: `POST`

## Files Modified

1. `app/room/[room]/page.tsx` - Enhanced mobile UI and added manual webhook trigger
2. `app/api/manual-webhook/route.ts` - Created manual webhook endpoint
3. `app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Enhanced webhook processing
4. `app/api/test-livekit-webhook/route.ts` - Created test webhook endpoint
5. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added debugging logs
6. `app/test/page.tsx` - Created test page for webhook verification

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your hosting platform
2. **Set environment variables** in your deployment settings
3. **Test the mobile UI** on actual devices
4. **Test webhook functionality** using the test page
5. **Configure LiveKit webhook** for automatic triggering
6. **Monitor the dashboard** for AI summaries after calls

## Troubleshooting

### If webhooks still don't work:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Firebase Admin initialization
3. Check console logs for detailed error messages
4. Test with the manual webhook first
5. Ensure LiveKit webhook URL is correct

### If mobile UI issues persist:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Test on different mobile devices
3. Check if CSS is being applied correctly
4. Verify no conflicting styles from other sources

### If AI summaries aren't generated:
1. Check OpenAI API key is valid
2. Verify API quota and limits
3. Check console for OpenAI API errors
4. Test with fallback summary generation
