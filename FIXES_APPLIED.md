# LiveKit Interface Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Overlapping Control Panels** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Multiple blue control panels were overlapping in the bottom-left area, creating confusion
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate control panels, keeping only the essential "Fix Control Panel" on the top-right
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed the large left-side control panel with room information
  - Removed the duplicate right-side room information panel
  - Kept only the clean "Fix Control Panel" with essential functions

### 2. **Leave Call Button Not Working** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: The "Leave Call" button only cleared localStorage but didn't actually disconnect from LiveKit
- **Solution**: Implemented proper LiveKit disconnection and cleanup
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `handleDisconnect()` function that properly cleans up LiveKit connection
  - Updated `onDisconnected` handler to properly update Firestore and redirect
  - Fixed button to use proper disconnect function instead of just clearing localStorage

### 3. **Disorganized Interface** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Controls were scattered and hard to distinguish, with inconsistent styling
- **Solution**: Streamlined interface with consistent design and better organization
- **Changes Made**:
  - Simplified left-side panel to just a "Back to Home" button
  - Improved Fix Control Panel styling with better spacing and visual hierarchy
  - Added hover effects and consistent button styling
  - Improved color scheme and visual feedback

### 4. **Duplicate Functionality** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Multiple panels had the same functions (copy patient link, join as patient, etc.)
- **Solution**: Consolidated all functionality into the single Fix Control Panel
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed redundant room information displays
  - Consolidated patient link functionality into one location
  - Streamlined button layout and functionality

## Technical Improvements

### Button Styling and UX
- Added hover effects with smooth transitions
- Consistent button sizing and spacing
- Better visual hierarchy with improved colors
- Added subtle shadows and animations

### Panel Organization
- Single Fix Control Panel with collapsible functionality
- Clean, organized layout with proper spacing

### LiveKit Integration

## Files Modified
- `app/room/[room]/page.tsx` - Main room component with all fixes

## Result
The interface is now:
- ✅ **Clean and organized** - No more overlapping panels
- ✅ **Functional** - Leave Call button works properly
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Clear control hierarchy and better UX

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the Leave Call functionality to ensure it properly disconnects
2. Verify that only one control panel is visible
3. Check that all buttons have proper hover effects
4. Ensure the interface is responsive and well-organized
5. Test the collapsible Fix Control Panel functionality
