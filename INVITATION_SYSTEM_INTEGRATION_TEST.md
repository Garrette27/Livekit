# Invitation System Integration Test

## Overview
This document outlines how to test the new invitation system integration with your existing AI summarization features.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Invitation Flow Test

**Steps:**
1. Login as a doctor
2. Create a room (e.g., "test-invite-room")
3. Use the new InvitationManager component to create a secure invitation
4. Set constraints:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Countries: US, CA
   - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox
   - Device binding: false
   - Expiration: 1 hour

**Expected Result:**
- Invitation created successfully
- Invite URL generated
- URL format: `/invite/[JWT_TOKEN]`

### 2. Patient Access Validation Test

**Steps:**
1. Open the invitation URL in a new browser/incognito window
2. Verify the validation process:
   - Device fingerprint collection
   - Geolocation check
   - Browser validation
   - Email validation (if implemented)

**Expected Result:**
- Validation passes
- Patient joins the video call
- LiveKit token generated and used

### 3. AI Summarization Integration Test

**Steps:**
1. Start a video call using the invitation system
2. Have a conversation (or use the test transcription feature)
3. End the call
4. Check the dashboard for AI-generated summary

**Expected Result:**
- Call data stored in `calls` collection
- Webhook triggered on call end
- AI summary generated and stored in `call-summaries` collection
- Summary appears in doctor's dashboard

### 4. Security Violation Test

**Steps:**
1. Create an invitation with specific constraints
2. Try to access from a different country (use VPN)
3. Try to access from a different browser
4. Try to access with a different device (if device binding enabled)

**Expected Result:**
- Access denied with appropriate error messages
- Security violations logged in invitation audit trail
- No LiveKit token generated

### 5. Expiration Test

**Steps:**
1. Create an invitation with 1-minute expiration
2. Wait for expiration
3. Try to access the invitation

**Expected Result:**
- Access denied with "expired" error message
- No LiveKit token generated

## Database Collections

### New Collections Added:
- `invitations`: Stores invitation data and constraints
- `audit_logs`: Security violation logs (if implemented)

### Existing Collections (Unchanged):
- `calls`: Active call data (works with invitation system)
- `call-summaries`: AI-generated summaries (works with invitation system)
- `rooms`: Room metadata (works with invitation system)
- `consultations`: Consultation tracking (works with invitation system)

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints:
- `POST /api/invite/create`: Create new invitation
- `POST /api/invite/validate`: Validate invitation and generate LiveKit token

### Existing Endpoints (Unchanged):
- `POST /api/token`: Generate LiveKit tokens (still works for direct access)
- `POST /api/webhook`: LiveKit webhook handler (works with invitation system)
- `POST /api/track-consultation`: Consultation tracking (works with invitation system)

## Security Features

### Implemented:
1. **JWT-based invitation tokens** with expiration
2. **Multi-constraint validation**:
   - Email verification
   - Country/IP geofencing
   - Browser validation
   - Device fingerprinting (optional)
3. **Single-use invitations** (can be configured)
4. **Audit trail** for all access attempts
5. **Rate limiting** on all endpoints
6. **Input validation** and sanitization

### Security Headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Integration Points

### 1. AI Summarization
- **No changes required** - works automatically
- Webhook processes all room types the same way
- Transcription data collected from `calls` collection
- Summaries stored in `call-summaries` collection

### 2. Dashboard
- **No changes required** - works automatically
- Shows summaries from all room types
- Filters by user ID (createdBy field)

### 3. Room Management
- **Enhanced** with invitation system
- Legacy room links still work (marked as unsecured)
- New secure invitation system available

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create invitation with various constraints
- [ ] Validate invitation access from allowed location/browser
- [ ] Test security violations (wrong country, browser, etc.)
- [ ] Test expiration handling
- [ ] Test single-use functionality
- [ ] Verify AI summarization works with invitation-based calls
- [ ] Check dashboard shows invitation-based call summaries
- [ ] Test device binding (if enabled)
- [ ] Verify audit trail logging
- [ ] Test rate limiting on invitation endpoints

## Performance Considerations

### Database:
- Invitation validation: O(1) with proper indexing
- Audit trail: O(n) where n is access attempts
- Cleanup: Automatic expiration handling

### Security:
- JWT verification: O(1)
- Geolocation lookup: O(1) with caching
- Device fingerprinting: O(1)
- Rate limiting: O(1) per request

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Base URL for invitation links
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`: Used for JWT signing
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`: Used for LiveKit token generation

### Dependencies:
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing JWT, crypto, and validation libraries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Invitation validation fails**: Check JWT secret configuration
2. **Geolocation not working**: Verify IP geolocation service
3. **Device fingerprinting issues**: Check browser compatibility
4. **AI summarization not working**: Verify webhook configuration

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint responses
3. Check Firestore collections for data
4. Verify environment variables
5. Check LiveKit webhook configuration

## Conclusion

The invitation system integrates seamlessly with your existing AI summarization features. No changes are required to the AI processing pipeline - it will automatically work with invitation-based calls just like regular calls.

The system provides enhanced security while maintaining full compatibility with your existing features.
